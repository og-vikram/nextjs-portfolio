## My Personal Website (work in progress!)

I had a spare Raspberry Pi Zero just lying around collecting dust so I wanted to put it to use; I decided I was gonna turn it into a web server and host a website on it. I thought it'd be cool and hopefully I could teach myself web development along the way. Turns out hosting a website on a Pi is a headache in and of itself, leading me down several rabbit holes in order to fix issues that kept popping up. To save my own peace of mind, I decided to host it on Netlify instead but still tried to make the site :)
